# City-Skyline-Night-Blackout
Full moon night as a backdrop to a blacked out city skyline. This project transitions from day time to night time depending on the size of the browser from which its being viewed.

This project is a simple webpage that displays a city skyline using HTML and CSS. The webpage consists of two sections - the background buildings and the foreground buildings. The background buildings are displayed in the back of the webpage, while the foreground buildings are displayed in the front.

The HTML code defines the structure of the webpage, while the CSS code defines the styles for the webpage. The HTML code includes a head section that defines the title of the webpage and links to an external CSS file. The body section of the HTML code contains the elements that make up the city skyline.

The CSS code uses variables to define the colors of the buildings and the windows. It also defines the styles for the various elements of the city skyline, including the background buildings, foreground buildings, and windows.

To view the city skyline, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The city skyline is designed to be responsive, meaning that it should adjust its size and layout to fit the screen size of the device being used to view it.

This project is intended to serve as a simple example of how HTML and CSS can be used to create a visually appealing webpage. It can be used as a starting point for more complex projects or as a standalone example of a basic webpage.
